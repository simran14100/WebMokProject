# Backend Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement a 5-role system (Student, Instructor, Admin, SuperAdmin, Staff) with enrollment fee payment functionality for students.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Model Updates (`models/User.js`)
- **New Roles**: Updated `accountType` enum to include 5 roles: `["Student", "Instructor", "Admin", "SuperAdmin", "Staff"]`
- **Payment Fields**: Added new fields for enrollment fee tracking:
  - `paymentStatus`: "Pending", "Completed", "Failed"
  - `enrollmentFeePaid`: Boolean flag
  - `paymentDetails`: Object containing orderId, paymentId, amount, paidAt

### 2. Authentication Updates (`controllers/Auth.js`)
- **Registration Flow**: Modified signup to handle role-based approval logic:
  - Students: Auto-approved but need to pay enrollment fee
  - Instructors: Need admin approval
  - Admin/SuperAdmin/Staff: Auto-approved, no enrollment fee
- **Login Flow**: Updated to check enrollment fee payment for students
- **Response Enhancement**: Added `requiresPayment` flag in responses

### 3. Middleware Updates (`middlewares/auth.js`)
- **New Role Middleware**: Added `isSuperAdmin`, `isStaff`, `isAdminLevel`, `isAdminOrSuperAdmin`
- **Admin Level Access**: `isAdminLevel` allows Admin, SuperAdmin, and Staff access
- **Category Creation Access**: `isAdminOrSuperAdmin` allows only Admin and SuperAdmin (excludes Staff)
- **Enhanced Security**: Better role-based access control
